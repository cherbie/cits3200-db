    2. Skills and Resources Audit
        - Worked on a smaller version of this in our unofficial first meeting 
        - Need to clarify further and expand into more detail
        - An audit of what skills and tools the team needs to successfully carry out the project, and therefore what needs to be learnt/acquired (and from where).
        - Discuss where we can bring together all these resources to share to the team (shared drive folder)
    3. Risk Register

    4. Project Acceptance Tests
        - How will you know that the project has been successful? 
        - Like the Scope of Work, this can be as informal as a bullet-point list or as formal a formal test manual
