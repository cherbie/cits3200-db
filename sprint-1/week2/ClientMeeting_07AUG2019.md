## Discussion Items
 1. Introduction to the Research Development Team (RDT)
    - They deal with the medical faculty (and are based there)
    - Three month study can entail thousands of dollar grants
 2. Pivot is a global database that is already establish
    - When you search, grants in USA will appear instead of local and applicable grants
    - A lot of mis-searches etc.
    - UWA have a licence and pay big dollars to use their service.
 3. Currently implement a database using confidence?
    - Aaymen may be familiar with this software
    - Some kind of platform that the university uses to share documents with users
    - Prior to current system pdf attachments to emails were implemented
 4. Current issues
    - Students cannot access conference / database
    - Search function in the database is quite "clunky"
      - e.g *"are you an early career researcher"*
    - You can't be specific with a study for instance search "brain cancer"
 5. Sina's Role
    - Research Support Officer
    - Sina finds opportunities and adds tot he database all the information
    - The researcher search for grants applicable to themselves
    - Source funding opportunities for our researchers but we want to create something
    - End goal
      - Increase likelihood of receiving funding and increase profitability of UWA
 6. Function of the searchable database
    - The link from the database leads them to the actual website of the funding
    - Only provides an overview of the opportunity and some of the parameters for researchers to _quickly_ access
 7. Improvements / Ideal Outcomes
    - List of opportunities that are specific to the researcher
      - Search function
    - Include the small Australian grant opportunities for researchers (added by Sina)
    - pivot will maintain global outlook and be used alongside the UWA / local searchable database
 8. Database user roles and access
    - Currently the UWA IT restrictions on UWA pheme account
    - Only UWA staff and students can access the database
    - Certain staff gain advanced privileges
    - All students can access the database not just PhD students
    - Need it to be closed / internal to UWA
      - Curtin students should not be able to steal / be aware of research grants available
    - Staff numbers start with triple zero
 9. Walkthrough of database
    - *To be later confirmed with screenshots provided by **Sina** *
    - Opportunities closing in the next three months
    - Full year list of opportunities
