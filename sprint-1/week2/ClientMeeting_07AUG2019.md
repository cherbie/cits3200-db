## Discussion Items
    1. Introduction to the Research Development Team (RDT)
       - They deal with the medical faculty (and are based there)
       - Three month study can entail thousands of dollar grants

       - Prior to current system pdf attachments to emails were implemented
    4. Current issues
       - Students cannot access conference / database
       - Search function in the database is quite "clunky"
         - e.g "are you an early career researcher"
       - You can't be specific with a study for instance search "brain cancer"

        - Need it to be closed / internal to UWA
            - Curtin students shoudl not be able to steal / be aware of research grants available
