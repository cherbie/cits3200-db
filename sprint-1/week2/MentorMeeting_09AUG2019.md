## Discussion Items
    1. Introduction to Ray
       - Electrical engineer that started at Honeywell
       - Enjoys hacking at night as side projects
       - Currently the manager at an IT firm
    2. IT Information
       - Look for solution designs (see [SIPROC](http://siprocsystems.com/))
       - The solution is effectively putting a skin over the database
    3. Confluence
       - Our team cannot do anything with this in terms of working with the currently implemented system
    4. To-do
       - Identify whether we need to create the database
       - Need to look at the audience to develop tailored UI
       - Create the SQL database
       - Create the UI using UI frameworks
    5. Database ideas
       - SQL
       - Using the filesystem
         - .asp page
         - Only a few records hence
       - MongoDB
         - Saving XML files
       - MSSQL?
       - Could use sharepoints
       - ASP is suggested with UWA
    6. SQL
       - MySQL is good for small database applications
       - Suggestion of *MsSQL*
    7. Pheme account
       - Pheme will essentially give you a token
    10. User interface (UI)
        - Biggest challenge
        - Needs to be smart
          - Needs to be tested in many browsers
        - e.g *Paralax effect with images as you scroll down to add to the UI*
        - Changes with the content
    11. Javascript Framework
        - Suggested in order to support user interface
        - Angular?
        - React?
        - Bootstrap
        - jQuery
    12. Using React
        - Responsive search bar so need to send client side queries to the database
    13. SideCore
        - ASP and MS
    14. Application
        - something rendering the input and the other fields
        - something quering the data
    15. Static vs non-static
    16. Adopt existing Framework
        - Sharepoint?
    17. SiteCore
      - The CMS that UWA use
      - Students have access to this

## System Requirements
  1. Identify platform
  1. Develop schema of the Database
  2. Then use user interface applications / frameworks
  3. Decide on back-end manager
