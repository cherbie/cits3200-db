## Discussion Items
 1. Introduction to Ray
    - Electrical engineer that started at Honeywell
    - Enjoys hacking at night as side projects
    - Currently the manager at an IT firm
 2. IT Information
    - Look for solution designs (see [SIPROC](http://siprocsystems.com/))
    - The solution is effectively putting a skin over the database
 3. Confluence
    - Our team cannot do anything with this in terms of working with the currently implemented system
 4. To-do
    - Identify whether we need to create the database
    - Need to look at the audience to develop tailored UI
    - Create the SQL database
    - Create the UI using UI frameworks
 5. Database ideas
    - SQL
    - Using the filesystem
      - .asp page
      - Only a few records hence
    - MongoDB
      - Saving XML files
    - MSSQL?
    - Could use sharepoints
    - ASP is suggested with UWA
 6. SQL
    - MySQL is good for small database applications
    - Suggestion of *MsSQL*
 7. Pheme account
    - Pheme will essentially give you a token
 8. User interface (UI)
    - Biggest challenge
    - Needs to be smart
      - Needs to be tested in many browsers
    - e.g *Paralax effect with images as you scroll down to add to the UI*
    - Changes with the content
 9. Javascript Framework
    - Suggested in order to support user interface
    - Angular?
    - React?
    - Bootstrap
    - jQuery
 10. Using React
     - Responsive search bar so need to send client side queries to the database
 11. SideCore
     - ASP and MS
 12. Application
     - something rendering the input and the other fields
     - something querying the data
 13. Static vs non-static
 14. Adopt existing Framework
     - Sharepoint?
 15. SiteCore
     - The CMS that UWA use
     - Students have access to this

## System Requirements
  1. Identify platform
  1. Develop schema of the Database
  2. Then use user interface applications / frameworks
  3. Decide on back-end manager
