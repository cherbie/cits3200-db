# cits3200-db
The development of an online searchable database providing access to research funding opportunities from Australian and global sponsors/providers. This will be accessible to UWA staff and students only as it will require a Pheme username and password. This database will be updated and maintained by the UWA Research Development Team (RDT). Staff and students will be able to access open/current opportunities that will be categorised by Faculty. They will be able to filter their search by various options such as opportunities that are targeted to early career researchers, for travel, equipment etc. Each opportunity will contain further details including funding provider, max amounts, max duration, and online links to funding opportunity details.
